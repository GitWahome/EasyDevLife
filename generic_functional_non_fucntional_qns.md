# System Design Requirement Questions to ask

If you are a beginner in system design, it might be overwhelming to figure out where to start. Here are some examples of good system design questions to help you get started, along with their functional and non-functional requirements:

## Example 1: How would you design a system that can handle a large amount of traffic?

- **Functional Requirements:**
    - The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent requests.
    - The system should be able to scale horizontally to accommodate increased traffic.
    - The system should be able to handle different types of requests (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    - The system should have high availability and be able to handle failures without affecting the user experience.
    - The system should have low latency and respond quickly to user requests.
    - The system should have high throughput and be able to process a large number of requests per second.

## Example 2: Can you design a system that can store and retrieve large amounts of data efficiently?

- **Functional Requirements:**
    - The system should be able to store and retrieve data efficiently.
    - The system should be able to handle large amounts of data.
    - The system should be able to handle different types of data (e.g. structured, unstructured, semi-structured).
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    - The system should have high availability and be able to handle failures without losing data.
    - The system should be able to scale horizontally to accommodate increased data storage requirements.
    - The system should have low latency and respond quickly to data retrieval requests.

## Example 3: How would you design a system that can handle user authentication and authorization?

- **Functional Requirements:**
    - The system should be able to authenticate users based on their credentials.
    - The system should be able to authorize users based on their roles and permissions.
    - The system should be able to handle different types of authentication (e.g. username/password, OAuth, SAML).
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    - The system should have high security and protect user data from unauthorized access.
    - The system should have high availability and be able to handle failures without affecting the authentication and authorization process.
    - The system should have low latency and respond quickly to authentication and authorization requests.

## Example 4: Can you design a system that can handle real-time data processing and analysis?

- **Functional Requirements:**
    - The system should be able to process and analyze data in real-time.
    - The system should be able to handle different types of data (e.g. structured, unstructured, semi-structured).
    - The system should be able to generate real-time insights and visualizations.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    - The system should have high availability and be able to handle failures without losing data.
    - The system should have low latency and respond quickly to data processing and analysis requests.
    - The system should have high throughput and be able to process a large number of requests per second.

## Example 5: How would you design a system that can handle concurrency and parallelism?

- **Functional Requirements:**
    - The system should be able to handle multiple requests simultaneously.
    - The system should be able to execute multiple tasks concurrently.
    - The system should be able to handle different types of requests (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    - The system should have high availability and be able to handle failures without affecting the user experience.
    - The system should have low latency and respond quickly to user requests.
    - The system should have high throughput and be able to process a large number of requests per second.

Remember, the key to good system design is to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable components. By asking these types of questions, you can start to think about the different components of a system and how they interact with each other. Good luck!
